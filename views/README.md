# Django Views Template

## Concepts Covered in the Template

### Class-Based Views (CBVs)

Class-based views refer to a method of defining views using classes instead of functions. CBVs provide a more structured and reusable approach to handling HTTP requests and generating responses.

### Generic Views

Generic views are a type of class-based view that offers pre-defined, reusable views for common use cases. They aim to reduce repetitive code and simplify common web development patterns.

### Function-Based Views (FBVs)

Function-based views are a way of defining views using regular Python functions. They are the simplest and most basic approach for handling HTTP requests and generating responses in Django.
