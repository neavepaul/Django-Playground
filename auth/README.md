# Django Authentication Template

## Concepts Covered in the Template

### Authentication

The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. This ensures that users are who they claim to be and can access appropriate resources within the application.

### User

Represents an individual who interacts with the Django application. A user typically includes information such as username, password, and email.

### Registration

The process of creating a new user account in the application. This allows users to provide necessary details to set up their account and gain access to the application's features.

### Login

The process by which a user provides credentials (such as username and password) to access a protected area of the application. Successful login grants access to restricted resources.

### Logout

The process of ending a userâ€™s session and removing their authentication status. This ensures that the user's session is securely terminated and that they must log in again to regain access.
